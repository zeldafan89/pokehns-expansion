**`pokemonHnS-expansion`**, aka Pokémon Heart and Soul 2.0, is a GBA ROM hack that is both a remake of GSC and demake of HGSS, with added quality-of-life, customization, and more.  
Originally built on top of [resetes12's **`Modern Emerald`**](https://github.com/resetes12/pokeemerald).  
Now additionally built on top of [RHH's **`pokeemerald-expansion`**](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion) GBA ROM hack base.  
Finally, all of these projects are built on top of [pret's **`pokeemerald`**](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) decompilation project.

> Pokémon Heart & Soul brings the classic Johto Region and its iconic story to the world of modern GBA decomp hacking. Built on Modern Emerald and pokeemerald-expansion, this project offers a fresh take on the GSC/HGSS experience, blending key aspects of the Gen 2 and Gen 4 games, while incorporating many modern QoL features, as well as some familiar mechanics from Gen 3 to Gen 9. Not only is Heart & Soul (HnS) a first-of-its-kind, fully completed, playtested, and largely faithful GSC remake / HGSS demake, it's also completely open source, and is intended to be a base for a new generation of Johto rom hacks.

Unfortunately, saves from before 2.0 will not be compatible moving forward.

2.0.1 will be the last "official" release of Pokémon Heart and Soul, after which any bug fixes, content updates, or any propogated updates from **`pokeemerald`** or **`pokeemerald-expansion`** will only be available via community forks of the project.

# AI Disclosure
Since this is a controversial topic at the moment, we'd like to be transparent about use of AI for this project.

Every line of code written for the game is either hand-written or manually reviewed by a member of the team. However, it is still important to point out that LLMs like Claude Code and GitHub Copilot have been used for some tasks.

Here is what AI has been used for:
- Code Reviews of hand-written code
- Debugging more complex scenarios
- Auto Completion (stuff like repeating lists, DebugPrints, etc.)
- Creating Python Scripts for I/O procedures (like downloading/writing list data, I/O data with Excel, etc. namely for documentation)

AI has not been used for:
- Generating assets of any kind; Art or Music
